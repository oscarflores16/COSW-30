        <p>Hello, I am Oscar. Welcome to my journey in Web Development! I am twenty years old, and I am excited about learning PHP. I enjoy doing various activities. My line of work currently includes working at a local Target store. I enjoy going to the gym and playing basketball.

        <?php 
            echo 'The Web is such a fun filled universe. I enjoy going to different websites every day. There are two main websites that I choose to visit: <a href="nba.com"target="_blank">NBA</a> and <a href="reddit.com"target="_blank">Reddit</a>';
            echo 'This assignment was very fun. I actually enjoy seeing these three languages being put to use. I remember when I only knew HTML, but now with CSS, PHP and JavaScript I am able to see the true power of these web languages. It was not as difficult as I first though it would be, mainly because I just put all the knowledge I have of them together and see how HTML structures them. PHP is not really shown in this assignment but we will see more of it soon!'
